VERDICT
=======
+ Have to hacksaw the set! to the-global-environment since trying to modify the
  prim-table doesn't modify the global environment without the set! akin to a
  hard-reset to the value running the risk making even more garbage than what
  could be acceptable, but hey, it works.

+ Thought installs must be inside s450 but it's just going to be in UMB-Scheme
