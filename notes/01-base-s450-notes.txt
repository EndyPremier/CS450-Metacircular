Key notes:
+ Handling of special forms (quote, define, if, lambda, begin, cond)
    works as expected
+ cons and null work as expected, but cadr, cdar, and
    many other nested forms of car and cdr doesn't exist.
+ Other primitive procedures like any calculations (+, -, *, /, etc) or even
    conditional statements doesn't exist.
+ Any errors in (s450) environment essentially crashes the entire environment
    and be resorted back to base Scheme as there doesn't exist any form of
    monads in the environment for error checks. That being said, existing
    procedures/variables that are in the root environment retains after
    crashing.
+ Any underlying procedures that runs the (s450) environment cannot be used in
    (s450) itself - presumably out of stability and all of the procedures are
    only via variables and primitives.
