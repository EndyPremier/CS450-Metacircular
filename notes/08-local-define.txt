POTENTIAL SPECIAL FORMS            -> EVAL-CALLBACKS
==================================    ---------------------------------
+ (defined?              <symbol>) -> (def?-callback       <exp> <env>)
+ (locally-defined?      <symbol>) -> (frame-def?-callback <exp> <env>)
+ (make-unbound!         <symbol>) -> (unb!-callback       <exp> <env>)
+ (make-locally-unbound! <symbol>) -> (frame-unb!-callback <exp> <env>)

HOW TO INSTALL THE NEW SPECIAL FORM
+ Add the evaluation scripts to the main s450.scm code
+ install-primitive-procedure <'name> <evals>

ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE
(cons var val) :: frame
(cons frame env) :: environment-frame

+ Much of my frustration earlier was from trying to find a solution of deleting
  an individual entry and how to do that with two list simultaneously
  -> delete-in-frame
+ Annoying conditional cases and early exits and unaware of actual counts
+ expand the test example for checking definition generally
